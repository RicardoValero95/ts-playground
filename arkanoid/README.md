# Arkanoid game 

[Create an Arkanoid Game with TypeScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bejSTim38A&t=488s)

Pure TS, no React.
Also I changed Parcel to SnowPack. 
I think it was faster.

What I don't like:
- side effects
- class constructors
- the collision physics are very basic
- the loop
## Prerequisite
NPM, TypeScript globally
## Setup
1. Initialize npm 
1. Install snowpack
1. Install snowpack-typescript
1. Snowpack config
1. Typescript config 
1. Package scripts
1. Run 
`npm run start`
